# Intro

The main goal to start this program was to refresh my knowledge and set myself on the developer road. My career began as self-taught programmer and the time came to set things straight. Technology has changed our lives by increasing the speed of time and sometimes you need to step back and look at everything in different perspective. One of the many aspects I have enjoyed about my job is the ability to manage my time by myself. If you asked me what I could do without being paid, it would be something that would leave some mark on the world. Not necessarily major impact but even a small achievement would be great. We can make the world a better place by helping each other. Working as a community, we are bound to achieve more and, therefore, provide more.
